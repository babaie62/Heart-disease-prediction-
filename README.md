Heart disease prediction using supervised machine learning algorithms: Performance analysis and comparison

A B S T R A C T
Machine learning and data mining-based approaches to prediction and detection of heart disease would be of
great clinical utility, but are highly challenging to develop. In most countries there is a lack of cardiovascular
expertise and a significant rate of incorrectly diagnosed cases which could be addressed by developing accurate
and efficient early-stage heart disease prediction by analytical support of clinical decision-making with digital
patient records. This study aimed to identify machine learning classifiers with the highest accuracy for such
diagnostic purposes. Several supervised machine-learning algorithms were applied and compared for performance
and accuracy in heart disease prediction. Feature importance scores for each feature were estimated for all
applied algorithms except MLP and KNN. All the features were ranked based on the importance score to find
those giving high heart disease predictions. This study found that using a heart disease dataset collected from
Kaggle three-classification based on k-nearest neighbor (KNN), decision tree (DT) and random forests (RF) algorithms
the RF method achieved 100% accuracy along with 100% sensitivity and specificity. Thus, we found
that a relatively simple supervised machine learning algorithm can be used to make heart disease predictions
with very high accuracy and excellent potential utility.
